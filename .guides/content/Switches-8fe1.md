Switches are like electrical junction boxes – they are used to connect the individual devices in a LAN. Data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices.

A network switch has connections for data cables from the devices on the network.

Switches are intelligent! When messages are sent across the network they contain the addresses of the devices they are intended for – just like the addresses on envelopes.
A switch can read these addresses and send the messages to the intended devices rather than just broadcasting them to every one on the network.
