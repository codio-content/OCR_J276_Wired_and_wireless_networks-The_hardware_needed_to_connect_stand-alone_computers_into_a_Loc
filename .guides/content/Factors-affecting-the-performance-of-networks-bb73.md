- The **bandwidth** of the medium as it is the maximum amount of data that can pass through the medium per second.

- **Hardware** and **software** limitations (switches and routers) can affect performance.

- **High number of users** can cause network congestion, leading to messages being queued before they can be transmitted by routers and switches.

- **High network traffic** can lead to collisions of data packets resulting in transmission errors. The packets have to be retransmitted.
