The two main ways that devices are networked is by cable and radio waves – wired and wireless connections.

## Cable

These are either copper or fibre optic cables.
Copper wire carries the data as electric currents, and in fibre optic cable they are
transmitted as pulses of light generated by a light emitting diode (LED) or a laser.

Fibre optic cables can carry signals far faster than copper cable and the signals can travel over greater distances without needing to be boosted.

Fibre optic cables also have a far greater bandwidth – 10 Gbps as compared to the 1 Gbps of copper wires.

## Radio waves

Radio waves are a type of microwave and they are used to transmit data across networks in
frequencies of between 2.4 and 5GHz.

The most commonly used standard of data transmission using radio waves is
Wi-Fi. Others include GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), used for
mobile phones, e.g. 3G and 4G; Bluetooth and Wi-Fi direct.
