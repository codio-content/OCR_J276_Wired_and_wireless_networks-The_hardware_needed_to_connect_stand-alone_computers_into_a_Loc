Routers connect different LANs together.
Routers are similar to switches â€“ they read the address information in a message and
forward the messages towards the correct network that contains the device it is intended for.
The messages are passed from router to router and gradually get closer and closer to the intended network and individual device.


Routers are commonly used in the home to allow many computers to share an internet connection. The router links the home network to a much larger one: the internet.
